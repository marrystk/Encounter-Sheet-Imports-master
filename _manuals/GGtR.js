Rakdos performers enjoy dressing cacklers in a variety of masks, hats, and costumes to lampoon public figures. Demonic \"Devils\" The creatures called \"devils\" in Ravnica are minor demons akin to quasits. While the larger demons embody evil qualities such as blood lust and torment, these lesser demons reflect the whimsical and chaotic side of Rakdos and his cult. Their mischievous antics cause disorder and destruction out of proportion to the demons' small size. Diabolic Demons Many of the demons of Ravnica are monstrous, winged creatures of human-like form. They are best represented by the statistics of the nalfeshnee, the shadow demon, or the vrock in the Monster Manual. Demons associated with the Cult of Rakdos often have fiery attacks that make them similar to barbed devils or horned devils, except that they are demons.

They coax new morphologies from existing creatures or combine traits from multiple organisms into one, producing the creatures known as krasis. Some krasis are unique creatures that can't reproduce. A few multiply and become part of the guild's standard menagerie. Creating a Krasis: To create a krasis, choose the appropriate stat block: category 1 (Medium), category 2 (Large), or category 3 (Huge). Then roll once on the Major Adaptations table and once on the Minor Adaptations table (or choose an option from each table) to determine its additional characteristics. The potency of some adaptations varies based on the category of the krasis, as indicated in the descriptions of those adaptations. Just a few examples of krasis are the battering krasis (a fusion of hammerhead shark and a powerfully built beast), the crocanura (a crocodile-frog), the drakewing krasis (a lizard-drake), the teratosuchus (a crocodile-crab), the shambleshark (a shark-crab), and the sharktocrab (an improved shambleshark that includes octopus elements as well). d8 | Major Adaptation 1 | Acidic Skin. Any creature that touches the krasis or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage (category 1), 4 (1d8) acid damage (category 2), or 6 (1d12) acid damage (category 3). 2 | Armored Hide. The krasis has better natural armor afforded by a shell or thick scales, increasing its Armor Class by 4. 3 | Bioluminescent Markings. The krasis has glowing patterns on its skin that take the shape of defensive runes, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. 4 | Flight. The krasis has wings and gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed. 5 | Grabber. When the krasis hits a creature with its claws, the target is grappled (escape DC 13 for category 1, DC 15 for category 2, and DC 19 for category 3) by a specialized grasping appendage on the krasis. It can have only one creature grappled in this way at a time. 6 | Hypnotic Display (Recharge 5-6). As an action, the krasis creates mesmerizing colors and shapes around itself. Each creature within 15 feet of it that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12 for category 1, DC 14 for category 2, and DC 18 for category 3) or be stunned for 1 minute. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this effect becomes immune to the Hypnotic Display of all krasis for 24 hours. 7 | Venomous Sting. When the krasis hits a creature with its claws, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 12 for category 1, DC 14 for category 2, and DC 18 for category 3) or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the krasis is a category 2 or 3, the creature is paralyzed while poisoned in this way. The poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 8 | Regeneration. The krasis regains hit points (2 for a category 1, 5 for a category 2, and 10 for a category 3) at the start of each of its turns if it has at least 1 hit point.  d8 | Minor Adaptation 1 | Amorphous Structure. The krasis can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. 2 | Aquatic. The krasis gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed. 3 | Climbing Speed. The krasis gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed. 4 | Cryptic Skin. The krasis can change color to match its surroundings. It has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. 5 | Heightened Awareness. The krasis can't be surprised, as a result of having sensitive barbels like a catfish, stereoscopic vision like a chameleon, a tongue like a snake, eye stalks like a lobster, or an array of several eyes. 6 | Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). While underwater, the krasis can use a bonus action to expel a cloud of ink and then move up to its speed. The ink cloud is stationary and fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point in the krasis's space before it moves. The sphere is heavily obscured until the ink disperses after 1 minute. A strong current also disperses the ink cloud. 7 | Leaping Legs. With or without a running start, the krasis's long jump is 20 feet (category 1), 30 feet (category 2), or 40 feet (category 3). Its high jump is 10 feet (category 1), 20 feet (category 2), or 30 feet (category 3). 8 | Stabilizing Legs. The krasis has several crablike legs. As a result, it has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.",

Imagining itself generous and merciful, the angel usually tries to grant the petitioners what they seek by using its abilities, drawing from its hoard of riches, or extorting favors from other members of the guild. True to the spirit of the Orzhov, though, the angel doesn't bestow these gifts out of kindness, but for the sake of gaining fanatical followers who owe it life debts. Debt and Indenture Those who receive favors from a deathpact angel incur a debt that they carry with fervent devotion. They regularly bring trinkets and offerings to the angel, no longer asking or expecting anything in return, and even willingly offer up their mortal lives for their angelic patron. Even after death, these debtors continue to serve the angel and the Orzhov Syndicate as indentured spirits (described later in this chapter). Debts Paid Orzhov Angels: Few angels find anything appealing in the corruption and decadence embodied by the Orzhov Syndicate, since such a society is fundamentally antithetical to their natures, but disillusionment can seduce even immortal beings. When cynicism takes root in an angel's heart, when questions undermine devotion to the cause of justice, when strength becomes a tool to lord over the weak, the Orzhov Syndicate is there to welcome the angel with open arms, offering status, respect, and power. Orzhov angels might claim positions as executioners, commanders, or power brokers, but more often they carve out their own place in the guild, standing apart from the otherwise rigid hierarchy of the Orzhov.",

		description: "Horrors and Madness: Horrors on Ravnica are terror and madness personified. You can represent this reality by using the madness rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide. Whenever a character fails a saving throw against the flying horror's Frightening Screech, the shadow horror's claw attack, or the skittering horror's Maddening Presence, note that fact. At the end of the encounter, have each character who failed at least one of those saving throws make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, nothing happens. On a failed save, a character gains a form of madness from the Dungeon Master's Guide, with the severity depending on how many of the saving throws that character failed during the encounter, as shown on the Madness Severity table. Failed Saves | Madness 1 | Short-term 2-3 | Long-term 4+ | Indefinite  Horrors: Terrifying evils stalk, fly, and scuttle in the dark corners of Ravnica, from the depths of the undercity to the blackest parts of the night sky. Collectively, these creatures are called horrors-a variety of things that lurk in the dark and embody the deepest fears of Ravnica's people. All are evil creatures with dim reason and preternatural cunning. At least three guilds have been known to compel horrors into service. For House Dimir, horrors spread fear and despair in the citizenry and carry out assassinations or kidnappings against well-protected targets. For the Cult of Rakdos, horrors are simply one more weapon in an arsenal of terrifying and shock-inspiring creatures that might appear on stage. For the Golgari Swarm, horrors scavenge the sewers and protect the guild's territory. House Dimir uses all three base kinds of horrors. The Cult of Rakdos prefers shadow horrors, and the Golgari Swarm uses skittering horrors. Customizing a Horror: Horrors share some common body types but vary wildly in other characteristics. A particular horror's form might incorporate elements that resemble fiendish, insectile, or reptilian features. To customize a horror, choose a base creature (flying horror, shadow horror, or skittering horror), then roll once on the Primary Features table and once on the Secondary Features table (or choose an option from each table). Add those features to the base creature.  d4 | Feature 1 | Avoidance. If the horror is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. 2 | Damage Resistances. The horror has resistance to necrotic and psychic damage. 3 | Innate Spellcasting. The horror's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13 for flying horror, DC 16 for shadow horror, and DC 17 for skittering horror). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 3/day: darkness 1/day each: fear (shadow horror and skittering horror only), phantasmal killer (skittering horror only) 4 | Psychic Rebuke. When the horror takes damage from a melee attack, it can use its reaction to emit psychic energy within a 5-foot radius. Each creature in that area takes 3 (1d6) psychic damage (flying horror), 7 (2d6) psychic damage (shadow horror), or 10 (3d6) psychic damage (skittering horror).  d4 | Feature 1 | Grasping Tendrils. The horror has four tendrils. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 12, 10 hit points). Destroying one deals no damage to the horror. As a bonus action, the horror can target one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be grappled by the horror. The DC of the saving throw and the DC to escape the grapple are the same: 9 for the flying horror, 13 for the shadow horror, and 19 for the skittering horror. Until the grapple ends, the horror can't use the same tendril to grapple another target. 2 | Indomitable Mind. The horror is immune to the charmed condition. 3 | Keen Senses. The horror has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, sound, or smell. 4 | Mind Sight. Magical darkness doesn't impede the horror's darkvision.",

Vampires: Creatures of the night, vampires are ageless undead beings who subsist on the blood of the living. They are fierce predators who mask their ravenous thirst behind a facade of sophistication and sensuality. Those who sip blood from golden chalices are no less voracious than those who tear out their victims' throats with their fangs; they just hide it better. The vampires of Ravnica differ from those in the Monster Manual in important ways. They lack the traits and abilities that those other vampires boast, but also lack the weaknesses that hinder such vampires.

		description: "Horrors and Madness: Horrors on Ravnica are terror and madness personified. You can represent this reality by using the madness rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide. Whenever a character fails a saving throw against the flying horror's Frightening Screech, the shadow horror's claw attack, or the skittering horror's Maddening Presence, note that fact. At the end of the encounter, have each character who failed at least one of those saving throws make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, nothing happens. On a failed save, a character gains a form of madness from the Dungeon Master's Guide, with the severity depending on how many of the saving throws that character failed during the encounter, as shown on the Madness Severity table. Failed Saves | Madness 1 | Short-term 2-3 | Long-term 4+ | Indefinite  Horrors: Terrifying evils stalk, fly, and scuttle in the dark corners of Ravnica, from the depths of the undercity to the blackest parts of the night sky. Collectively, these creatures are called horrors-a variety of things that lurk in the dark and embody the deepest fears of Ravnica's people. All are evil creatures with dim reason and preternatural cunning. At least three guilds have been known to compel horrors into service. For House Dimir, horrors spread fear and despair in the citizenry and carry out assassinations or kidnappings against well-protected targets. For the Cult of Rakdos, horrors are simply one more weapon in an arsenal of terrifying and shock-inspiring creatures that might appear on stage. For the Golgari Swarm, horrors scavenge the sewers and protect the guild's territory. House Dimir uses all three base kinds of horrors. The Cult of Rakdos prefers shadow horrors, and the Golgari Swarm uses skittering horrors. Customizing a Horror: Horrors share some common body types but vary wildly in other characteristics. A particular horror's form might incorporate elements that resemble fiendish, insectile, or reptilian features. To customize a horror, choose a base creature (flying horror, shadow horror, or skittering horror), then roll once on the Primary Features table and once on the Secondary Features table (or choose an option from each table). Add those features to the base creature. d4 | Feature 1 | Avoidance. If the horror is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. 2 | Damage Resistances. The horror has resistance to necrotic and psychic damage. 3 | Innate Spellcasting. The horror's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13 for flying horror, DC 16 for shadow horror, and DC 17 for skittering horror). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 3/day: darkness 1/day each: fear (shadow horror and skittering horror only), phantasmal killer (skittering horror only) 4 | Psychic Rebuke. When the horror takes damage from a melee attack, it can use its reaction to emit psychic energy within a 5-foot radius. Each creature in that area takes 3 (1d6) psychic damage (flying horror), 7 (2d6) psychic damage (shadow horror), or 10 (3d6) psychic damage (skittering horror).  d4 | Feature 1 | Grasping Tendrils. The horror has four tendrils. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 12, 10 hit points). Destroying one deals no damage to the horror. As a bonus action, the horror can target one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be grappled by the horror. The DC of the saving throw and the DC to escape the grapple are the same: 9 for the flying horror, 13 for the shadow horror, and 19 for the skittering horror. Until the grapple ends, the horror can't use the same tendril to grapple another target. 2 | Indomitable Mind. The horror is immune to the charmed condition. 3 | Keen Senses. The horror has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, sound, or smell. 4 | Mind Sight. Magical darkness doesn't impede the horror's darkvision.",

Occasionally, cultists bring would-be recruits to the demon's presence, and—true to its name—the sire of insanity breaks the new cultist's mind. A sire of insanity is a bloated demon resembling a bipedal lizard. It stands some thirty feet tall and weighs many thousands of pounds, so it tends to keep hidden away in its subterranean lair, working its evil from the shadows. Demonic \"Devils\" The creatures called \"devils\" in Ravnica are minor demons akin to quasits. While the larger demons embody evil qualities such as blood lust and torment, these lesser demons reflect the whimsical and chaotic side of Rakdos and his cult. Their mischievous antics cause disorder and destruction out of proportion to the demons' small size. Diabolic Demons Many of the demons of Ravnica are monstrous, winged creatures of human-like form. They are best represented by the statistics of the nalfeshnee, the shadow demon, or the vrock in the Monster Manual. Demons associated with the Cult of Rakdos often have fiery attacks that make them similar to barbed devils or horned devils, except that they are demons. (They are chaotic evil, they speak Abyssal and not Infernal, and they lack Devil's Sight.)",

In the midst of increasing tensions on Ravnica, the three personalities have recently been at odds over how best to navigate the conclave through such difficult times. Trostani spends most of her time in the towering tree of Vitu-Ghazi, the Selesnya guildhall.

The transformation is rapid, leaving the victim as a stone statue, usually frozen in a position of abject fear or agony-a fine trophy for the medusa's macabre collection. The medusa must exert its will to effect this transformation, so the gaze of a surprised or friendly Ravnican medusa is harmless. This deadly gaze attack gives medusas a degree of power among the Golgari that is out of proportion with their small numbers. Medusas command a significant share of the guild's smaller cells around Ravnica, and at least one medusa is thought to be angling for control of the entire guild at the moment. Not all gorgons are so ambitious; some prefer to simply stalk the endless shadows of the undercity like hungry predators.",
