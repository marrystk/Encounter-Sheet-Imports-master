**v1.62** *(11/18/18)*

* Fixed issue with 'Skills' not showing properly
* Added in the Constitution Modifier for the hit dice due to demand
	
**v1.61** *(7/19/18)*

This one is all bug fixes! I highly recommend deleting all previous copies to make sure you're using this version. I would also love to know if this alerts people when I update? Is there any other way I should be alerting people? Let me know.

* Went through and tested all monsters so none of them should error out. Please report any oddities and bugs on [GitHub](https://github.com/Shwaffle/Encounter-Sheet-Imports/issues)
* Changed the verbiage of two-handed variant attacks in the descriptions to make it more apparent
* Fixed a bug where some attacks wouldn't show based on the ability
* Small code changes for consistency


**v1.6** *(7/7/18)*

This feels like a small update due to the changelog, but I think the way I reworked how you choose a monster is such a big addition that I wanted to push it out as quickly as possible. This has been something I've wanted to add for quite a while so it feels nice that it's finally finished. This is the groundwork I needed to get the different lists into the sheet so let me know what you think!
	
*Added an icon for Tortle Package for fun
*Added info on how to contact me

**v1.51** *(7/2/18)*

* Fixed a typo that caused Tales from the Yawning Portal not to work.

&nbsp;

**v1.5** *(6/24/18)*

Per usual I took too long with me recent update. This is a big one so I hope it makes up for the delay in the new manuals! 

&nbsp;

I would love to have some input from users on what they think needs to be changed or added. After submitting this file, I'm going to begin work in a single page monster sheet. This will be extremely beneficial for boss level monsters that have a large traits/actions section. After that, I would like to work on an initiative order page! That sounds like a fun challange so I hope it turns out well. I appreciate everyones support and thank you for using my sheet! You can contact me at the GitHub link below, or you can message me on Reddit @ [Shwaffle](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shwaffle). 

&nbsp;

I have also put all of the monster information up on my Github. You can view all of the data and submit errors at: https://github.com/Shwaffle/Encounter-Sheet-Imports

&nbsp;

**Fixes**

* Fixed the font size of Speed so it's actually readable.
* Encounter XP was only pulling the XP from the top monster. I am very sorry for those that relied on this and were given the wrong information.
* Previous versions of the sheet would disable form highlighting for Adobe globally. This has been fixed to re-enable form highlighting on close.
* Fixed a lot of errors in Monster Imports
* 
**Additions**

* Added Tome of Beasts.
* Added Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes.
* Added The Tortle Package.
* Added radio buttons at the top to select whether or not you would like Adobe's field highlighting. I think it looks better off, but choose what you'd like!
* Added some nice icons for the manuals you select.

&nbsp;

**v1.4** *(2/18/18)*

**Fixes**

* I really, really broke actions in 1.32 somehow. This has been fixed, and I can't believe I hadn't noticed earlier.
* Fixed multiple Spellcasting blocks.
* STR mod had a 2 character limit, which broke when monsters had anything over +9 to the mod. This has been fixed.
* Fixed a lot of data issues that weren't properly coded.

**Additions/Changes**

* Redid the manual selections at the top, this will allow for a lot more adaptability.
* Manually changing the ability score now modifies saves and mods.
* Added a bunch of tooltips!
* Added Elemental Evil (Out of the Abyss), Tyranny of Dragons (Hoard of the Dragon Queen, Rise of Tiamat), Curse of Strahd, Storm Kings Thunder, and Yawning Portal.
* Added a lot of missing monsters, thank you to those who have let me know!
* Added encounter name and location at the top, suggested by users!
* Underneath the monster's name you can now select a checkbox to manually change the name of the monster without it killing the stats. Suggested by users!
* Added Type & Subtype if applicable!
* You can now search for a monster name! 
    * It is case sensitive
	* Adobe DC currently has a bug that makes this feature not 100% reliable. However, being able to search in the dropdown should help a significant amount with the major manuals.


Going to be working hard to get Tome of Beasts complete before Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes is released in May.

* Trying new Clear Form buttons
* Traits and Actions will begin to display nicer when they have multiple paragraphs

* Rest of Monster Manual added
* Began work on allowing DMs to have initiative rolled for the monsters. Will have both singular initiative and group initiative. (The extra radio button that pops up when you choose the monster won't do anything for now)

* Began work on encounter difficulty
